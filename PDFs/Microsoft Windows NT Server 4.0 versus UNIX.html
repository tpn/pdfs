<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

<p>IT managers worldwide are being confronted with the question, should
we go with Microsoft Windows NT Server or one of the UNIX operating
systems? As you may already know, UNIX is not a single operating
system; it refers to a family of operating systems which includes AIX,
BSDI, Digital UNIX, FreeBSD, HP-UX, IRIX, Linux, NetBSD, OpenBSD,
Pyramid, SCO, Solaris, SunOS,  just to name the more prominent ones. 
Windows NT Server is increasing in popularity, but is it increasing the
productivity of your MIS operations?  Most important of all, though,
for you as a manager is, are you increasing the profits of your company
when you choose a Microsoft solution?

</p><p>The bottom line is, which is cheaper?  Hardware costs, software
licenses, technical support agreements, prices of upgrades/service
packs, costs of hardware upgrades, profits lost for every hour of
downtime, personnel costs for recovering/recreating data lost due to
product defects in the operating system and/or hardware platform
required by your choice of operating systems, and personnel costs for
systems administrators, these are only some of the factors that
contribute to the overall budget resulting from your decision.	It is
not a trivial consideration.

</p><p>Although money is the bottom line for you as a manager, given the
complex set of factors I've just presented, a technically superior
combination of server hardware and operating systems could prove to be
less expensive in the long run.  UNIX is a mature, technically superior
group of operating systems with a proven track record for performance,
reliability, and security in a server environment.  The almost thirty
years of continual development, performed often by volunteers who
believe in what they're doing, has produced a group of operating
systems--and extremely powerful multiprocessor server hardware
tailor-made to its needs, whose performance is still unparalleled by
Intel hardware--that not only meets the demands of today's computing
needs, but in many cases exceeds them.	

</p><p>Why Windows NT Server 4.0 continues to exist in the enterprise would
be a topic appropriate for an investigative report in the field of
psychology or marketing, not an article on information technology. 
Technically, Windows NT Server 4.0 is no match for any UNIX operating
system, not even the non-commercial BSDs or Linux.  A manager is not
expected to have the technical expertise of a systems administrator
with 15 years of industry experience.  There is no shame in not having
the facts, only in being ignorant of such facts, which will in the end
cost your employer, and eventually all consumers, money. The aim of
this article is to give you the resources which will enable you to make 
thoughtful and informed decisions regarding your organization's 
IT planning and operations.

</p><p>The following article relies on my experience in this industry,
which started back in 1979 with Chevron Geosciences Company, and on
roughly 150 links to other technical articles, white papers, and
executive summaries.  At this point it should be noted that  I am not
promoting the product of any one company, nor would my employer benefit
should you choose UNIX.  My goal is to ease the burden of systems
administrators, promote more efficient and economical computing
worldwide, and encourage a more fair and diverse community of software
vendors.

<h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>

The choice of server platforms can be difficult for managers who do not
have highly specialized training in systems and network administration.
In this paper, Microsoft Windows NT Server is compared to UNIX, a large
family of commercial and non-commercial operating systems with a common
heritage and many similarities.  The main focus of the comparison is on
the areas of functionality, reliability, system management, and
performance. This paper is about servers, not workstations.  Other
factors, such as product pricing, quantity and quality of bundled
software, and a section on common misconceptions about both groups of
operating systems are presented to provide a more complete view of
these products.  The information used in this comparison is derived
from a variety of sources: white papers, case studies by third parties,
articles from technical periodicals, and observations made by IT
professionals who have industry experience in the implementation and
administration of both Microsoft Windows NT and various UNIX operating
systems.

<p>This article should be considered a work in progress.  Anyone
wishing to contribute to this project is welcome to send me <a href="mailto:feedback@unix-vs-nt.org"><b>e-mail</b></a>.  Please confine your

<p>Most managers will agree that the mere cost of an operating system
is trivial when looking at the big picture.  Although Windows NT Server
4.0 can be more expensive than some commercial UNIX operating systems,
it can be had for trivial amounts at trade shows.

Is NT Server really worth its price?  See <b>

NT Lies: Lie 6 - NT Server is worth more</a></b>. What
is not trivial, however, is that a networked operating system in this
price range should ship without a telnet server, SMTP server (e-mail), 
disk quotas, news server, or at least a DNS server that works to
customers' satisfaction (many NT administrators feel compelled to go
with third party DNS solutions). In order to match the functionality of
a BSDI installation, additional Microsoft products and third-party
solutions would bring the final price of a comparable NT solution to
around $4,000, according to <b>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000815100517/http://www.bsdi.com/white-papers/compare">BSDI</a></b>. 
Maggie Biggs, a senior analyst in the InfoWorld who specializes in
database technology and application design, development, and deployment
via intranets and other networks, estimates a price of <b>$4,636 for a
comparable Windows NT 4.0 solution</b> in her <b>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000815100517/http://currents.net/magazine/national/1524/inet1524.html">
article</a></b> which compares NT 4.0 to Red Hat's <i>commercial</i>
Linux (for only <b>$49.95</b>).
Here one sees that successful marketing can often distract customers
from considering their need for functionality.

<p>NT is often chosen for budget reasons since many customers are not
willing to pay for the more expensive hardware required by most
commercial flavors of UNIX.  More important, however, is the overall
cost of implementation which includes system administration along with
several other factors like downtime, telephone support calls, loss of
data due to unreliability, etc.  For a more detailed discussion of NT's 
hidden costs, see the following

</p><p>Nicholas Petreley, editor-in-chief of <i>NC World</i> and columnist
for <i>InfoWorld</i> and <i>NT World Japan</i> provides an explanation
for the rise of Linux and FreeBSD in IT departments:

</p><blockquote>
"Yesterday's college students learned their UNIX expertise on Linux and
FreeBSD. Today they're working in IT departments, and many of them are
openly hostile to both Microsoft and Windows NT. As a result, Linux,
BSD, Solaris, and other forms of UNIX are finding their way into IT
departments, both overtly and on the sly. 

<p>"For example, are you sure that's an NT server you're connecting to
at work? IS employees in many corporations have secretly installed UNIX
servers that provide native NT services. Why take such a risk? Linux
and FreeBSD are free, as is SAMBA, the software that provides NT
services. So the IS department saves money. And managers are unlikely
to find out UNIX is behind the scenes because fewer people will
complain about server downtime. 

</p><p>"Fewer people will complain because the servers are more stable than
Windows NT. Linux, FreeBSD, and BSDI UNIX outperform Windows NT by a
wide margin on limited hardware, and under some circumstances can
perform as well or better than NT on the best hardware. Once behind in
scalability features, UNIX on Intel is catching up and may soon surpass
NT in the number of processors it can use, and how it uses them.

<h3><a name="functionality">Functionality</a></h3>

What can you expect from Windows NT Server out of the box and from UNIX
out of the box?  NT can communicate with many different types of
computers.  So can UNIX.  NT can secure sensitive data and keep
unauthorized users off the network.  So can UNIX. Essentially, both
operating systems meet the minimum requirements for operating systems
functioning in a networked environment.  Put briefly, UNIX can do
anything that NT can do and more.  

<p>NT is often considered to be a "multi-user" operating system, but
this is very misleading.  An NT server will <i>validate</i> an
authorized user, but once the user is logged on to the NT network, all
he/she can do is access files and printers.  The NT user cannot just
run <i>any</i> application on the NT server (in order to take advantage
of the superior processing power of server hardware).  An NT user can
only run special applications that have been written in two pieces,
i.e.  client/server applications.  When a user logs in to a UNIX
server, he/she can then run <i>any</i> application (provided the user
is authorized to do so), thus taking the processing load off his/her
workstation.  This also includes graphics-based applications since
X-server software is standard issue on all UNIX operating systems.

</p><p>For most businesses, e-mail has become an indispensable tool for
communication, and most companies run their own internal/external
e-mail systems.  With Windows NT, you will have to buy a separate
software package in order to set up an e-mail server.  UNIX operating
systems come with a program called <b>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000815100517/http://www.sendmail.org/">Sendmail</a></b>.  There are other
mail server software packages (or <i>MTAs</i>, Mail Transport Agents)
available for UNIX, but this one is the most widely used, and it is
free.  Some UNIX administrators feel that 
<b><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000815100517/http://www.exim.org/">exim</a></b> or 
<b><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000815100517/http://www.qmail.org/">qmail</a></b> are better choices
since they are not as difficult to configure as sendmail.  Both exim
and qmail, like sendmail as well, are free for use even in a commercial
environment. 
Many NT-based companies use 
<b><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000815100517/http://www.microsoft.com/exchange/default.asp">
Microsoft Exchange Server</a></b>
as their MTA.  This is an expensive solution with limited success in an
enterprise environment.  <b>Microsoft Exchange Server Enterprise
Edition - 25 Client Access Licenses costs $3,549.00.</b>
If you have more than 25 employees, the same package with <b>50 Client
Access Licenses costs $4,859.00</b> (Source:

Microsoft Exchange versus Sendmail: 
Views of Other MIS Professionals</a>.

</p><p>Since Microsoft sees NT as a viable alternative to all other
network-capable operating systems on the market, UNIX and Novell
included, one would assume that NT would come with all the tools
necessary to  accomplish the most basic tasks required: file and
printer services.  Any systems/network administrator knows from
experience that there are two important issues to be considered when
setting up a file server or adding a new network user: security, i.e.
passwords and file permissions; and quotas for limiting disk usage of
any new or existing users or groups.  Although NT provides basic
password security, it only provides file-level security if you choose
to use its proprietary filesystem called NTFS.	More important than
this issue, however, is that <b>NT does not provide any mechanism for
limiting a user's disk usage!</b> UNIX and Novell, on the other hand,
provide software for performing this seemingly elementary control. 
Microsoft has announced, however, that its not yet released NT Server
5.0 will provide "new storage management features such as disk quotas .
. ." (see their press release, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000815100517/http://www.microsoft.com/corpinfo/press/1997/sept97/winnt5pr.htm">
Windows NT 5.0 Beta Delivered to Over 200,000 Developers</a>). 

</p><p>Another disk related design flaw in the Microsoft suite of operating 
systems is its antiquated use of "drive letters," i.e. drive C:, drive 
D:, etc.  This schema imposes hardware specific limitations on system 
administrators and users alike.  This is highly inappropriate for 
client/server environments where network shares and file systems are 
to represent hierarchies meaningful to humans.  UNIX allows shared 
network filesystems to be mounted at any point in a directory structure.
A network share can also span multiple disk drives (or even different 
machines!) in UNIX, thus 
allowing administrators to maintain pre-existing directory structures 
that are well-known to users, yet allowing them to expand the available 
disk space on the server, making such system changes transparent to
users.  This single difference between the UNIX and Windows operating 
systems further underscores the original intentions of their respective 
designers: UNIX was conceived as a client/server operating system for 
professional use, whereas Windows and its descendents sprang from DOS, 
an operating system that was never intended to be a player in a 
client/server environment, much less a server.  For more detailed
information on this topic, see Nicholas Petreley's article 
<b>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000815100517/http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/displayNew.pl?/petrel/np102896.htm">
It will take less drive to make most PC operating
systems work like Unix</a></b>.

</p><p>Last but not least, UNIX operating systems are equipped with
scripting languages (Bourne Shell, Korn Shell, C Shell, and sometimes
Perl, just to name a few) and a "cron" facility for scheduling jobs to
run at fixed intervals (every <i>n</i> minutes, every <i>n</i> hours,
once a week, once a month, etc.).  Cron scheduling is highly
configurable and not just limited to these examples here.  In short,
high-level scripting languages + cron = a powerful resource for system
administration, the likes of which cannot be found in Microsoft NT
Server 4.0.  A great deal of UNIX system administration is automated
and customized for site-specific needs through the use of these tools,
which in effect cuts down on personnel costs.  As one reader pointed
out, NT does have a "Scheduler" and an "at" command, and that Perl is
available for NT. Yes, this is true, however, I don't feel that NT's
limited cmd.exe scripting environment combined with the "Scheduler" or
"at" can even begin to approach the functionality offered by the UNIX
tools I've mentioned.  One reader, Neil McKellar, provided an excellent 
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000815100517/http://www.unix-vs-nt.org/kirch/feedback/neil_mckellar.job_scheduling.html">
example</a> 
which supports this statement.

</p><p>Running automated tasks is only useful when the
scripts/tasks/executables can be run without human intervention.  So
much that runs on NT is GUI-based, and thus, requires interaction with
a human administrator.	If seen realistically, the types of automated
tasks that are being run in most shops are site-specific routines that
have to be programmed by system administrators.  Based on my own
industry experience, it is a rare site indeed where Perl is installed
on NT servers and there is any NT administrator who knows the first
thing about Perl.  The driving force behind buying cheap hardware goes
hand-in-hand with the hiring practice of selecting the cheapest NT
administrators available; after all, it's NT, all you have to do is
point and click! 

</p><p>To summarize, once you logon to an NT network, all you can do is
read files and print. In a UNIX environment, once you log in to a UNIX
server, you can <i>be</i> on that machine and do anything on it that
you could do if you were sitting at its keyboard <i>and mouse!</i>  With
NT, don't plan on being able to set up an e-mail server with the
software at hand.  You will need to buy expensive mail server software
like Microsoft Exchange Server separately.  If your NT server should
function as a file server - what else can you do with it really? -
don't plan on being able to prevent users from crashing the server by
filling up the disk(s) with their data.

</p><p>Ease of configuration and being able to configure a server without
causing downtime is yet another aspect of functionality:

</p><blockquote>
"Some versions of UNIX (Linux, for example) support loadable device
modules. This means you can boot Linux and reconfigure its support for
hardware and software on the fly. For example, you can boot Linux
without support for the SCSI card you have installed. You simply load
support for that SCSI card when you need to access one or more of the
SCSI-connected devices, such as an optical disk for backup. You can
unload the SCSI driver when you're finished. You can also freely load
and unload support for sound cards, network cards -- even file systems
such as HPFS, FAT, VFAT, and others (an NTFS driver is in the works). 

<p>"Any UNIX with loadable module support is therefore by nature more
appropriate for a server environment because almost all configuration
changes do not require system restarts. 

</p><p>"Windows NT doesn't even come close. Even insignificant changes to a
Windows NT configuration require or request a shutdown and reboot in
order to make the changes take effect. Change the IP address of your
default gateway and you need to reboot. You can't even change the type
of modem you use for a dial-up PPP connection without a reboot to
update the system. None of these limitations exist in UNIX.

<p>When it comes to more sophisticated networking functionality, it
seems that Microsoft's NT Server 4.0 Enterprise Edition can't hold a
candle to the more mature commercial UNIX operating systems.  Although
not essential to network performance, 64-bit computing is here today
with these UNIX operating systems (as opposed to NT's 32-bit operating
system).  D.H. Brown Associates Inc. reports the results of their
analysis as follows (the following quotation along with the table and
the three graphs immediately following the table are excerpts from a
Web page on Digital Equipment Corporation's site entitled 
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000815100517/http://www.unix.digital.com/unix/v4/dhbrown/AIX43.htm">
AIX 4.3 Leaps To 64-Bits In Dead Heat With Digital UNIX 4.0</a>):


</p><blockquote>
AIX 4.3 takes the lead in Internet/intranet networking features
by providing the broadest set of TCP/IP extensions and adding
value with a bundled Notes server. Digital UNIX comes in second
place with strong network security capabilities, bundling not
only Web-browsing capabilities but also Web-authoring tools, with
Navigator Gold, and a solid set of TCP/IP extensions. However,
Digital UNIX lacks advanced NFS features such as CacheFS and
AutoFS. IRIX 6.4 places third, bundling CacheFS and AutoFS, and
network security features almost as strong as Digital's. But IRIX
lacks network time facilities (NTP) and TCP/IP capabilities such
as IPv6 and IPSec. Sun follows, with good support for NFS
functions and the second-place array of TCP/IP extensions.
However, Sun relies on its own Web server, rather than Netscape, 
Microsoft or Apache, and lacks authoring tools as well as
important services such as Novell's NDS directory service. HP
provides strong Internet support within HP-UX, bolstered by its
good showing in advanced Internet protocol function and network
security, while lagging behind in support for advanced NFS
capability. HP-UX, along with AIX, has also established a lead in
supporting NDS. While Microsoft NT 4.0 provides Internet/intranet
support that overall rates as "Good," NT lags behind
the leading UNIX vendors due to poor support for directory
services, network security, NFS, and few TCP/IP extensions.
Microsoft has largely focused adding value to its bundled Web
server product and to tuning its Java Virtual Machine.

<h3><a name="reliability">Reliability</a></h3>

<p>In today's world, reliability is often more important than speed. 
Although performance is largely a function of hardware platform (see
the next section), it is in the area of <i>reliability</i> that the
choice of operating systems has the most influence.  Even if one
operating system offers more functionality, is more scalable, and
offers greater ease of system management, what good are these
advantages when a server processing real-time financial transactions is
plagued by frequent crashes resulting in unacceptable downtimes?  The
analogy of a fast, economical automobile with lots of gadgets, and
sporty appearance that frequently stalls in traffic despite repeated
visits to the authorized service center is actually quite
representative of Windows NT.

</p><p>
<a name="stability">One often hears about Windows NT Server</a>
being referred to as a "stable" operating system, but this is not
entirely accurate.  Were it so, then we wouldn't be reading articles
like <b>

"What do you use when failure is not an option?" he was bombarded by
"three times the usual number of vigorous e-mail replies."  Concerning
these replies he states:

</p><blockquote>

position that Windows NT was good enough. Quite the opposite: Several
messages expressed a resigned expectation that Windows NT 5.0 would
stagger out the door, burdened with immature add-on services but
without achieving corporate-class reliability in its basic functions.

<p>"I heard from one reader who said that at his site, Linux on a 486
is outperforming Windows NT on a 200MHz Pentium, and he has Linux
machines that have been running without interruption since before
Windows NT 4.0 was released.

</p><p>"I also heard from enterprise-class sites where Linux is considered
a proven choice, with source-code accessibility outweighing the dubious
advantage of more traditional vendor support. What others promise
someday, Linux gives many users now--at a bargain price.

<a name="ms-summit">Indeed,</a> Windows NT is a great improvement over Windows 3.1 or Windows
95, but it still has a long way to go before it can reach the level of
stability offered by even the 
<b><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000815100517/http://www.opensource.org/">
Open Source</a></b> (free) UNIX operating systems.  When
pitted against Sun Microsystems's Solaris, there's really no comparison
at all.  At the recent Microsoft Global Summit, 
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000815100517/http://www.crn.com/">Computer Reseller News</a> journalists
Barbara Darrow and Stuart Glascock interviewed some of the attendees:

<blockquote>
"We have a
Solaris box that hasn't been rebooted in two years," said
James Domengeaux, president of Comspace.Com, a
Houston-based Web reseller. In comparison, NT servers
are rebooted often, he said. "That's a problem especially in
e-commerce if you're talking transactions per second,
because how many orders do you miss?" he said.

<p>Windows NT's lack of stability is a known issue yet managers tend to
deal with it in discrete ways, reports one IT professional:

</p><blockquote>
"'I know three companies that are silently putting more and more into
UNIX . . . at the expense of NT, simply because NT falls over too
often,' says Peter Flynn, a consultant in Cork, Ireland. NT is known to
crash too frequently for many IT manager's tastes. Typical causes are
memory access violations and I/O errors. 

<p>"These companies aren't inclined to talk about their decisions
'because of pressure from upstairs,' Flynn says. 'The
buy-Microsoft-only ethos has taken over from the buy-IBM-only, and
managers who decided [against advice from technology people] to use NT
rather than UNIX are now unwilling to lose face,' he adds.

<p>Any IS professional who has worked in a Windows NT environment has
intimate knowledge of the infamous "Blue Screen of Death," a situation
in which the normal desktop windowing system disappears completely and
is replaced by a full screen of hexadecimal numbers on a blue
background.  The <i>only</i> method of recovery in this situation is
powering the machine off and rebooting.  What causes "blue screens" in
NT varies.  In my own experience, the following can induce this state
of failure:

</p><ul>
<li>When both IPX/SPX and TCP/IP protocols are used and technicians put
a machine with a static IP address on a different subnet;
</li><li>When some 16-bit Visual Basic applications are <i>not</i> being run
in "separate memory space."  NT does not run them in separate memory
space by default.  This is a <i>manual</i> configuration which should
be set for each and every 16-bit application on the machine;
</li><li>Certain brands of memory modules or cache will induce this, even
though the same hardware runs fine under other operating systems, such
as Windows 95.
</li></ul>

<p>In some situations, Linux too will complain about its hardware.  I 
personally have not experienced this despite having installed Linux on 
a wide variety of hardware, but it may happen.  It appears to happen 
mainly when one is compiling the kernel on a machine with bad memory. 
For more information see 
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000815100517/http://www.bitwizard.nl/sig11/">Signal 11</a>. 
The above list is by no means complete.  As a matter of fact, Tim
Newsham, a software developer for both Windows and UNIX platforms,
found this short list very misleading:

</p><blockquote>
In the BSOD section you mention a few ways that a BSOD can be caused.
I think this (small) list is misleading to the reader.  There are
<i>so</i> many ways that an NT system can crash, that by listing a
small number you are likely to give the wrong impression.  More
dangerous yet is the fact that your cases mostly involve a person who
is on the console doing something BAD to cause a crash.  Many of the
ways to crash an NT system happen inadvertently in the day-to-day
operation of the system (indeed, leaving the system on too long while
running a myriad of applications can cause bizarre crashes with little
clue to their cause).  Additionally malicious users can trigger crashes
due to shoddy implementation in software modules such as the login
program (LSA) or the tcp/ip stack.

</blockquote>

The "Blue Screen of Death" can be commonplace in some computing
environments and is often difficult to troubleshoot due to the either
cryptic or non-existent error reporting.  In addition to this, NT is
particularly prone to virus attacks on the Intel-based hardware.  For
operating systems on Intel hardware that must be booted from a hard
drive, i.e. NT Server, the Master Boot Record of a hard drive can be
the death of the operating system.  Linux, along with several other
UNIX operating systems that run on Intel-based hardware, can load a
compressed kernel from a boot floppy, thus avoiding this problem. What
this means is, an NT Server can theoretically be crashed by a virus
written 10 years ago for MS-DOS computers.  Anyone planning to deploy
an NT Server in a mission critical environment should consider this
fact.  I personally have encountered MBR viruses in a corporate
environment running Windows NT 4.0 (no Windows 95 clients!), and their
effects are devastating.  In addition to this, most viruses that would
incapacitate a Windows operating system don't have an effect on UNIX
operating systems since they often require the MS Windows environment
to do their damage.

<p>One real-life situation involving NT's reliability is reported by
the University of Nebraska Press's Information Systems Department
manager, Quinn P. Coldiron, who writes,

</p><blockquote>
Life after moving Cats [an order fulfillment and inventory system] to
NT was a nightmare. The system was crashing two to three times a day
with no reason that I could find. I was on the phone with Microsoft and
Cats constantly, but nobody could figure it out. Microsoft had me apply
Service Packs one through three and a few HotFixes, which helped, but
it still was crashing at least twice a week with the infamous "Blue
Screen of Death". After many weeks and about $1500.00 in phone support
from Microsoft, the technical support rep told me that I should find a
better software package than The Cat's Pajamas. This was not the
solution I was looking for, since this is the package that a sizeable
percentage of presses our size nationwide are running, so I was forced
to bring the old Novell server back into production until I could
figure something out. . . . Fourteen months later, we are running Linux
as our server.
</blockquote>


<p>The UNIX equivalent of the "Blue Screen of Death" would be called
"kernel panic."  It obviously exists, since I have heard and read about
it, but I've never been witness to it in my professional career. 
Although I am sure that UNIX servers do crash on occasion, these are
extremely rare events.	If and when a UNIX server crashes, it is almost
always due to a hardware failure of some sort.	Any software induced
problems in a UNIX environment generally make themselves known over a
period of time, sometimes in the form of overall gradual performance
degradation of the system, giving the administrator ample time to track
down the source of the problem, correct it, and stop/restart the
<i>process</i> (very rarely the entire machine!) causing the problem. 
In general, a UNIX server is halted only in the following situations:

</p><ul>
<li>Due to a hardware failure, for instance, a hard drive fails;
</li><li>A hardware upgrade needs to be performed;
</li><li>A lengthy power outage has occurred and the backup power supply
resources have been exhausted;
</li><li>The kernel is being upgraded.
</li><li>A beta kernel is being tested (not recommended for production 
environments).
</li></ul>

If none of the above the above occurs, then a UNIX system's uptime can
be measured in years.  NT, however, cannot boast of such periods of
uninterrupted service.	Even if one could eliminate the "Blue Screen of
Death," NT is hampered by its own design and use of
difficult-to-recreate proprietary binary configuration files, for
instance, the NT registry.  Read about a 
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000815100517/http://www.unix-vs-nt.org/kirch/massive-nt-failure.html">
massive NT failure</a> that
lead to over 10,000 NT machines being rendered useless for any task
requiring network resources.

<h3><a name="management">System Management</a></h3>

<p>The argument that Windows NT is easier to manage due to its GUI
(point-and-click graphical user interface) is unfounded.  The
advantage, if any, of GUI over CLI (command line interface, i.e. having
manually to type commands from a keyboard) is questionable.  The first
assumption is that Windows NT has an advantage over UNIX because of its
GUI.  This is wrong.  UNIX operating systems have a GUI as well (see
this 
<b>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000815100517/http://citv.unl.edu/linux/LinuxPresentation.html#Ease of administration">graphic example</a></b>). 

</p><blockquote>
"NT has long enjoyed an intuitive user interface for managing single
systems, largely benefiting from the exceptional familiarity of the
Windows look-and-feel adopted by the NT GUI. However, as users begin to
deploy large numbers of servers, and geographically-dispersed servers,
some of NT's architectural shortcomings for system management have
become more apparent, deriving primarily from its design as a
single-user system. The multi-user design of UNIX supports remote
access at multiple levels, including the ability to login with a
character session, via telnet, to edit configuration files, running GUI
tools over the network-enabled X Window System, and now through Java
versions of system management tools. NT currently enjoys none of these
features. Rather, remote NT management typically involves either
installing a local expert which Microsoft hopes will be easier due to
NT's larger volumes and similarity to mainstream Windows versions or
relying on layered system management products from Microsoft or third
parties. Neither option, though, quite matches the efficiency of
managing distributed UNIX systems."<br>

<h3><a name="performance">Performance</a></h3>

<p>Processing power is largely a function of computer hardware rather
than of operating system.  Since most commercial UNIX operating systems
run only on high-end workstations or servers, it would be ridiculous to
compare an

to anything Compaq or Dell produces.  UNIX has
been historically an operating system for high-end hardware.  To say
that UNIX outperforms NT based on the results of differing hardware
would be unfair to Microsoft.  On the other hand, Microsoft has
reduced, rather than increased, the number of hardware architectures it
supports.  NT for MIPS has been discontinued due to lack of customers
and PowerPC support is only marginal.  NT, now reduced to only x86 and
Alpha architectures will remain "a poor man's server" as it is commonly
referred to in the IT business.

</p><p>NT's lack of reliability is only surpassed by its lack of
scalability.  The superior scalability achieved by the commercial UNIX
operating systems on their respective hardware is the reason why large
corporations with high capacity computing needs cannot switch to NT
even if they wanted to. Mary Hubley, Research Director with the <b>

capabilities is based mainly on marketing hype:

</p><blockquote>
"Many people believe that NT is easier to use than it actually is,
scales better than it does, and is powerful enough to do what UNIX can
do. But most of this perception is due to great marketing by Microsoft,
and is not reality.

If high performance Windows file sharing is of utmost importance,
then one should consider choosing a server configuration that has
broken the world speed record for such services, an SGI machine
running IRIX:

<blockquote>
"Samba 2.0 has been benchmarked using the Ziff-Davis NetBench (R)
benchmarking suite, as the world's fastest Windows server, achieving
193 megabits per second file serving performance on a Silicon Graphics
(R) Origin 200 (R) server with 60 Windows clients."

NT</a></b> performance comparison and explains why:

</p><blockquote>
"Several times a month, customers in the printing and prepress industry
ask us what server platform they should use: Unix or
Windows NT. Windows NT might be acceptable for day-to-day operations in
the average business, but does not handle the loads that
publishers typically put on servers.

<p>The interesting thing about MikroGraf's 
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000815100517/http://www.ugraf.com/unix-nt/jt/unix-nt.nob.html">
UNIX vs NT comparison</a> is that the same hardware was used in two of
the four tests, a Digital Model 2100: once with Digital UNIX as the
operating system, and again with Windows NT on the same hardware.

</p><p>To be fair, one should compare NT Server's performance to that of
Linux or FreeBSD, since all three operating systems run on the same
hardware, Intel, the hardware-type most often used with NT. 
Unfortunately, a truly objective analysis of performance would have to
based on benchmarks, but these are not plentiful and usually only focus
on specific areas like Web performance:

Caldera OpenLinux vs. Windows NT: WebBench Performance Test</a>.  The
general consensus among IT professionals is, however, that Linux and
FreeBSD greatly outperform NT.	Considering that these UNIX kernels are
custom-compiled to contain only the software actually required by the
administrator, Linux and FreeBSD can function more efficiently than NT.
Inherently, any operating system requiring fewer resources will
outperform a more <i>bloated</i> operating system like NT.  UNIX does
not require a graphical user interface to function.  NT does.  Anyone
knows that graphics require incredible amounts of disk space and
memory.  The same holds true for sound files, which seem to be so
important to the Microsoft operating systems. 

</p><p>Benchmarks performed on similar UNIX operating systems using the

<h2><a name="misconceptions">Some Common Misconceptions</a></h2>

<p><b>NT is a toy operating system</b>

</p><p>For an operating system that <i>has</i> evolved from a toy operating
system, it offers some professional functionality.  Although it does
not scale very well -- performance goes down with more than 4 CPUs per
server -- it has come a long way.  Although I would not recommend it as
the primary operating system in an enterprise environment, it should
yield satisfactory performance for small businesses with fewer than 250
user accounts that do not run mission critical processes.  Please keep
in mind, however, that a single NT server will not be sufficient to
service 250 users.  The general recommendation is one PDC (Windows NT
Primary Domain Controller) and two BDCs (Backup Domain Controllers). 
Having other server applications on the PDC is also not recommended. 
Should RDBMS, E-mail, Web, and other typical services be required,
three NT servers will most likely prove to be insufficient. 

</p><p><b>By converting everything to Windows NT a company can eliminate
the problems of a heterogeneous networking environment.</b>

</p><p>The first assumption here is that a heterogeneous networking
environment is a problem.  I once worked at a company where NT and
Novell coexisted with very little conflict.  As a matter of fact, the
very reason for this coexistence was because Novell outperformed NT in
the area of file and printer sharing  services.  With UNIX, one can
create Microsoft-compatible file and printer sharing without the users
ever knowing that these services emanate from a UNIX server.  For all
they know, it's an NT server.  This functionality is provided for in
Sun's UNIX operating system, Solaris.  Linux can use a software package
called <b>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000815100517/http://samba.anu.edu.au/samba/">
Samba</a></b> that ships with most distributions to achieve this. Samba
is available for practically all UNIX operating systems.  It has also
been ported to VMS, MVS, OS/2, Stratus-VOS, Amiga, Novell, and MPE/iX.

</p><p>Wrong!  CDE (Common Desktop Environment) is a GUI desktop (Graphical

a colorful "desktop"; this is the basis for Microsoft's success.).  CDE

dissatisfied with your choice of <b>four GUI systems</b> that ship with
Linux: OpenLook, the GUI that Solaris used to use; FVWM, an

GUI that mimics the Windows 95 GUI (when looking at a single

find many more screenshots on his site than I am able to list here. 
Keep in mind that almost all of these window managers are highly
configurable; you shouldn't be surprised to see screenshots made of the
same window manager which look completely different.  As Matt states on
his page, "Let's face it, people are different, and those that use
computers use them in different ways for different tasks. So why do
some think we should all use (suffer?) the same interface?" 
Ironically, it is Microsoft's graphical user interface that is lacking
the features of customization.

</p><p>As for the claim that UNIX is behind the times, it is still the
operating system of choice for science, engineering, research, and
higher education.  Most engineers would choose UNIX over NT without
hesitation.  They are fully aware of its ability to be customized and
its tuning capabilities for the optimization of specialized computing
tasks.  Readers' feedback to 
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000815100517/http://www.isdmag.com/">isd</a> confirm this attitude:

"As we suspected, most designers are adamant: They want their EDA tools
to run under Unix. What's more, they say that Linux is
technically excellent by every measure, and NT simply isn't. Painfully 
aware that technical excellence doesn't guarantee market
share, many readers say that this time it should.

<p><b>Everyone is converting to NT anyway, we might as well gradually
replace our UNIX servers with NT servers.  It's the way of the
future.</b>

</p><p>If you talk to MIS managers of some large corporations who had UNIX
and Novell two years ago, and then replaced their Novell servers with
NT servers, you'll find that none of them can manage without their UNIX
servers.  It seems that heavy processing is still better accomplished
with UNIX servers.  So far in my career, every Oracle server I've ever
seen was running on a UNIX server.  One IT professional, however, did
send me e-mail saying, "I support several installations of ORACLE on
NT.  There are performance and functional issues that I encounter which
I have never seen on UNIX (Pyramid)."

<p><b>Robert Schindler, a mechanical engineer based in Florida who has
been working for the past decade as a free-lance consultant for various
Fortune 100 companies in the field of structural analysis, writes:</b>

</p><blockquote>
"It will be a long time before you hear me praise NT or any other MS
product.  I believe that Gates and his empire have done more to lower
the standards of our society than anything else in my lifetime.  If my
product had the same quality as theirs, airplanes would be falling out
of the sky hourly.

</p><blockquote>
"At my day job I work at a big firm. It's one of the biggest of its
kind in the world.  We decided to go with a Network Monitoring and
Management package from Cabletron.  It's available on both NT and Unix.
 The people who would run it gave them a blank check for the system to
be set up under NT because they were more familiar with NT than they
were with Unix.  About a year and a quarter million
dollars later, they finally gave up on NT and did it over with Solaris.
 Why?  NT just doesn't scale up.

<p><b>Tim Newsham writes in response to this article:</b>

</p><blockquote>
"I develop software in NT and in UNIX.	I despise NT.  It is a horrid
beast, it performs very very poorly and it is way too unstable.  Some
parts of NT are so broken that the majority of time porting software to
the system involves working around microsoft bugs.  It bothers me that
so many people are migrating away from unix to NT.  I can only imagine
that eventually there will be a large anti-NT backlash as management
types realize how much NT has hurt their organizations.

<p><b>Joseph Day, a consultant in Chicago, replies to Jessie Berst:</b>

</p><blockquote>
"I do a lot of software development on both NT, and 95. I can't seem to
understand why people are hyping up these platforms as being so great.
. . . The support you get in the Linux community through netnews is far
superior to anything that you will ever see with Microsoft products. .

that Linux has.<br>

<p><b>Quinn P. Coldiron, Information Systems Department manager for the

</p><blockquote>
"After completing the morning duties, we normally run a complete Cats
[an order fulfillment and inventory system] backup before we continue
with closing which usually would take two hours to complete on the
Netware server. The Linux machine was able to do the entire backup in
45 minutes, cutting a little over an hour off our closing time. This
increase in speed came from a decrease in hardware because the Linux
server was running only 32 MB in RAM and IDE hard drives where the
Netware server had 64 MB in RAM and SCSI drives. The speed increase has
been noticed in daily work also. I get almost daily remarks that the
system seems to be running faster and more reliable. 

<p>"We have recently upgraded the CPU to a 200Mhz Pentium and have
upgraded the Memory to 64 MB to handle the newest plans of making this
server replace our Windows NT file/printer server, which still crashes
about twice a month for no reason, even after an additional $1,500 in
tech support with Microsoft. This single computer running Red Hat Linux
will replace both our Novell Netware 3.11 server and our Windows NT 4.0
server, while decreasing total hardware requirements. With the recent
advances from the Samba team in supporting the NT domain structure and
the December 1997 release of Red Hat 5.0, I expect to have a very
efficient and inexpensive server for our Windows 95, Windows NT and
Macintosh clients. <br>

<p>The life-blood of the Internet is the Web.  This is the face that
the public sees. If your site is slow, plagued with technical problems,
or inaccessible, this will surely have adverse effects.  Since most
large corporations are UNIX-oriented, they normally go with Web server
software like Apache or Netscape-Enterprise.  
<b><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000815100517/http://www.apache.org/">Apache</a></b> 
was conceived with UNIX in mind.  It is free and currently rules the

</p><p>Microsoft's IIS is one of the few things that actually comes with
Windows NT. It does not possess any special or unique qualities not
already found in other Web server software. It excels neither in speed,

Their Web server kept returning the message <b>HTTP/1.1 Server Too 
Busy</b> despite my repeated attempts from my own domain and from 
other domains I telnetted into. The Web server never did manage 
to deliver their home page.  I simply gave up after 50 minutes of 
seeing the same error message from various clients in various domains. 
I have only ever seen this message from IIS Web servers. 
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000815100517/http://shop.tesco.co.uk/">Tesco</a> is running 
Microsoft-IIS/4.0.  Telnetting directly into their Web server on port 
80 revealed another unprofessional aspect of their site.  Despite the

off by 8 minutes and 51 seconds.

the immense popularity of the site it requires a robust operating
system and performance oriented Web server software.  Since all the

that NT servers running IIS would be the logical choice for their

<h2><a name="conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>

<p>Ironically, it seems from the observations of experienced system
administrators that UNIX would be the operating system of choice either
for installations on a tight budget or huge corporations with a demand
for high-powered multi-processor servers requiring a scalable operating
system. <i>Washington Post</i> Staff Writer, Elizabeth Corcoran,
provides us with a real-world example:

</p><blockquote>
Cincinnati Bell Information Systems, for instance, has used Sun
workstations and servers to process checks for several years. It
recently bought several top-of-the-line Sun servers to handle the
demands of a million bills a day. The choices, said James Holtman, CBIS
vice president, were either Sun servers or IBM mainframes. Microsoft's
technology "isn't quite there yet. It has a ways to
grow to match those-size systems," he said.<br>
(<i>The Washington Post</i>, Sunday, February 8, 1998; Page H01)
</blockquote>

Provided that a company is small to medium-sized, has few
mission-critical processes to be run, is willing to hire additional
administrators for their Microsoft Exchange and Internet Information
Server(s), and has a substantial budget for Microsoft's "per server" or
"per seat" licensing scheme, then NT would be the operating system of
choice.  The <b>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000815100517/http://www.aberdeen.com/">Aberdeen<i>Group</i></a></b> has published an excellent <b>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000815100517/http://www.aberdeen.com/research/comp/onsite/case1/body.htm">
case study</a></b> on migrating to Windows NT.


<p>NT is also an excellent choice for managers who need to show that
they used up their fiscal year budget for hardware/software
expenditures.  Perhaps this is why it requires no prior purchase
approval within federal agencies; "NT has become the 'unofficial'
standard operating system for the federal government.  Federal
employees whose responsibilities include the acquisition of computer
hardware/software require prior written approval from above before
ordering a UNIX operating system or hardware which cannot run Windows
NT.  For Intel-based hardware or Windows NT, no prior approval is
required." (as reported by a vendor of Sun solutions who wishes to
remain anonymous)

</p><p>For small shops or power users on a budget, or even medium to large
businesses who are beginning to escape the antiquated mind-set that
performance is best gauged by the last figure on the sales receipt,
Linux or FreeBSD can easily exceed the performance and functionality of
an NT solution, do it with inexpensive Intel-based hardware, and do it
for $0.00, a price Bill Gates will find difficult to beat.  Why invest
in an operating system that will require expensive training and
re-training with each new NT release?  UNIX/Linux administrators are
plentiful and generally more technically capable than their NT
counterparts (most UNIX administrators have some coding/scripting
skills seldom found among the new generation of "NT admins"). Why spend
almost $5,000 for MS Exchange Server (this price only covers 50 client
accesses), which in some companies, seems to only be able to handle the
e-mail of a few hundred employees when you can use the built-in
"Sendmail" mail server software that ships with Linux, a tried and
proven application capable of supporting the e-mail demands of
thousands of employees? 

</p><p>As to the actual overall features and performance of the two
operating systems, it seems that UNIX wins hands down.	It offers a
variety of vendors (no threat of a monopoly), scalability, more
efficient use of system resources, remote administration, remote
computing, multi-user capabilities, large palette of (professional)
software resources, vendor independent standards (POSIX), control of
users' disk usage (unlike NT), and can't be crashed by viruses written
10 years ago for DOS computers.  But the most important thing of all to
remember from this article when trying to choose between Windows NT and
one of the many UNIX operating systems is this:

</p><blockquote>
A <b>UNIX</b> operating system will give you <b>choices</b>: any type
of hardware, CLI or GUI, commercial or GNU, diverse choice of vendors.
It is <b>dynamic</b>, i.e. you can build a customized kernel to fit the
specific computing needs at hand.
<p><b>Windows NT</b> will give you <b>restrictions</b>: only Intel or
Alpha; no CLI, only GUI (try booting NT into CLI-only mode) and then
only one GUI (no wide choice of windowing systems as can be found under
X); only commercial MTAs, only Microsoft (ever heard of another company
marketing "NT Server clone" operating systems?), etc.  NT Server is
<b>static</b>, i.e. you will never be able to build a customized
kernel.  One size fits few.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Although Microsoft is not the only "restrictions-oriented" software
vendor promoting its own closed, proprietary solutions, one would hope
that organizations promoting open systems and solutions would prevail. 
Netscape is one vendor that promotes diversity and points out
Microsoft's pro-restriction, anti-choice stance regarding various
products: 

</p><blockquote>
[Our] strategy is in sharp contrast to that of vendors like Microsoft,
whose business model depends on customers upgrading to the most recent
version of each operating system. Consider that Microsoft's component
model, ActiveX, and the underlying components are designed to run only
on 32-bit Windows. Many Microsoft APIs also run only on 32-bit Windows.
For example, an application that uses ADSI (Microsoft's API to access
the LDAP directory protocol), will not run on existing Win16 clients,
much less on Macintosh or Unix systems. Netscape's LDAP API is
available on 17 platforms in C and many more in Java. In addition,
Microsoft's future platform services like "Viper's" transaction
processing and "Falcon's" messaging only runs on NT 5.0 - an Oracle
database running on Unix, for example, is not supported. The difference
is clear: with Microsoft, developers write to the Windows platform,
with Netscape, they write to the Internet platform.<br>

</blockquote>

<p>It would seem that the question of which operating system to choose
would be academic at this point based on the information I have
provided here, yet every day some highly-capable systems/network
administrator somewhere is told by his/her manager that the company is
switching over to NT.  The administrator is left stunned and confused,
for he/she already knows the information contained in this article.  It
is the management of your company who should be reading this.  All too
often management rocks the boat and disrupts the harmony of stable,
economical, and technically superior implementations when they suddenly
discover that an unapproved operating system has been in use for quite
some time, based solely on political reasons:

</p><blockquote>
"The corporate IT managers notice someday what is that box in the
corner and they tell them that it's the departmental Web server that's
been running for a year and a half, and by the way it's running Linux. 
One normal reaction is to upgrade it immediately to NT, but what
happens is that they go back to Linux because the performance
dropped.<br>

<b><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000815100517/http://www.unix-vs-nt.org/kirch/#cisco">details</a></b>).  Obviously, some of the technical
staff refused to comply with this order.  Why do you think that
technical people risk losing their positions over this issue?  I'll
leave this question for you to answer.


<p>If you are a manager, try to use this information wisely to enhance
the computing environment at your facility.  Talk to your technical
people and ask them what works.  Make the right decision.  Don't be
fooled by salespeople who use buzz words but can't explain them, let
alone explain their pertinence to <i>your company's</i> computing
goals.	Seek out companies who have implemented both Microsoft
<i>and</i> UNIX servers for the type of solution you are considering. 
Try meeting with their technical people to get objective, first-hand
reports on the feasibility, difficulty of implementation, and
initial+ongoing maintenance costs associated with your proposed
solution.

operating system are listed here.  Perl 5.0, for instance, is available
for all platforms, but Microsoft does not provide this with its
operating systems. On the same note, most distributions of Linux ship
with only about four GUIs (window managers) to choose from, yet you'll
note from a previous section in this article, that this is only a small
number of what is available for Linux, or any other UNIX operating
system for that matter.

switching from Linux to Windows NT:

</p><blockquote>
"Speaking of platform changes, Cisco Systems may be switching over its
internal network of print servers.  Apparently, the company's current
infrastructure is based on Linux and works very well, but that hasn't
stopped the guys at the top from wanting to mess with it.  I'm told
that in light of Cisco's ever-cozier relationship with Microsoft, its
senior management issued an order that the existing system be trashed
in favor of a Windows NT-based setup.  Word has it, though, that
inertia has won out, and despite the order from on-high, the printing
system is still -- you guessed it -- Linux-based.<br>

<h2><a name="acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</a></h2>

<p>I would like to welcome three new editors who are volunteering
their services to the UNIX versus NT Organization: Bengt Kleberg,
Gregory J. Pryzby, and Robert G. Werner.

</p><p>My very special thanks to Martin Vermeer, who, thanks to his advice
on form, argumentation presented herein, as well as having provided 
numerous valuable and sometimes explosive links, has been,
and continues to be, an invaluable contributor to the
positive development of this dynamic project.  My deepest appreciation
goes to the translators who have been generous enough to donate their
time to this worthy cause: Brian Lin for the Traditional Chinese and
Simplified Chinese versions, Davor Ocelic for the Croatian translation, 
Hanus Adler for the Czech translation,
Kobayashi Osamu for the Japanese translation, Donghun Han for the 
Korean translation, Bruno H. Collovini for the Portuguese translation,
and Ilgam Vasilyev for the Russian translation, and Carlos 
Lizárraga C. for the Spanish translation.
My thanks also to Nat Makarevitch, Sebastien Blondeel, and 
Dennis Allard who are currently working on the French translation,
and to Guglielmo Alfieri, Michele Dalla Silvestra, 
and Sergio Felleti who are working on the Italian translation.

</p><p>I would also like to thank the many readers who have contributed
links to important new articles on this topic, for instance, Lance 
Bayless, Klaus A. Brunner, 
Radovan Bukoci, 
Peter Chen, Reinier de Vos,
Martin Espinoza, 
Ariel Faigon, Paul Fischer, P. Gopalakrishnan, 
Colin Kabaara, 
Raj Mathur, Howard McKinney, 
Adrian Mikeliunas, 
Mike Miller, Mike Stephens, Jim Mohr,  
Gene Mosher, Philip Obbard, 
John Oram, Conrad Sanderson, Markus Senoner, Steve Sinnott, 
Ryan Sumner, Raj Warty, Ken Webster, and countless others.

</p><p>Equally appreciated is the constructive criticism from Keith H.J.
Bevins, Joris Braakman, Marty Cawthon, 
Phillip Chu, Baruch Cochavy, Nicholas Donovan,
Julian Elischer, Steve Fuller, Alex Gogan, Jake Hamby, Peter Jeremy,
Adam Johnson, Geoffrey King, Hannu Krosing, Greg Lehey, Kimberly
McBride, Richard Smith, and David Waine, to name just a few.

</p><p>No less important was the assistance provided by Leif Erlingsson and
Damon Conway back around the end of March when I had to upgrade my
connection and needed their mirroring services, both of whom continue
to provide mirrors to this site.  Last but not least, my thanks to Ryan
Sumner for his everlasting moral support on this project.
