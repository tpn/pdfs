All PDFs are present in the [PDF folder](./PDFs). Files have spaces in names and if you need to replace all spaces with underscores for better command line processing, run the Python script [rename.py](./rename.py) or the Bash script [rename.sh](./rename.sh).

Usage:
Using BASH script

Open terminal and enter following commands:
```sh
# Make the bash script executable and execute from the root directory of the repository.
chmod +x rename.sh
./rename.sh
```
Using Python script

Open terminal and enter following commands from root directory:
```sh
python rename.py
```
